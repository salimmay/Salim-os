## 🚀 What's New in v2?

v2 transforms the project from a simple visual demo into a **gamified experience**:

- **🤖 SalimAI Assistant:** A terminal-based chatbot that answers questions about my skills and experience using regex-based heuristics.
- **📁 Virtual File System:** A working "My Computer" app with folder navigation, breadcrumbs, and password-protected "Top Secret" directories.
- **📺 Retro CRT Mode:** A global shader effect that turns the entire UI into a 90s curved monitor with scanlines.
- **🏆 Achievement System:** A toast notification engine that tracks user exploration (e.g., *Achievement Unlocked: Script Kiddie*).

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 The Interface
- **5 Dynamic Backgrounds:** Switch between Gravity, Singularity Core, Vortex, Event Horizon, and Digital Fortress.
- **Desktop Physics:** A "Gravity Prank" that causes all desktop icons and windows to fall and bounce at the bottom of the screen.
- **Smart WiFi Menu:** A creative dropdown where "Available Networks" are actually links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email.
- **System Sounds:** Interactive audio feedback for startup, clicks, errors, and notifications.

### 🛠️ App Ecosystem
- **💻 Interactive Terminal:** Features a **"Hacker Typer"** mode—smash any keys to write perfect code automatically.
